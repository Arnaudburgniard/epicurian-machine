# Epicurian Machine

## ðŸŽ¨ Concept

*Epicurian Machine* is a digital meditation on the modern conditionâ€”an evolving collage of sound and image that blurs the boundary between memory and media, presence and past.

By simply pressing keys, the user stirs an avalanche of overlapping video and audio fragmentsâ€”layers of sensory material that accumulate, collide, and fade. This accumulation becomes a metaphor: for the things we consume and forget, for the memories that distort with time, for the flood of information we absorb without reflection.

No two interactions are ever the same. The system's ensures each encounter is uniquely unpredictableâ€”like the way each memory refracts differently with time, or how no two days of digital life feel quite alike. What appears in one moment may never be seen the same way again.

Originally imagined in 2013 as a Flash AS3 experiment with Tristan Gevaux, and reborn over a decade later in JavaScript, the piece embodies its own themes: reinvention, technological decay, and the quiet persistence of creative intent.

*Epicurian Machine* does not provide answers. Instead, it offers a spaceâ€”where abundance becomes abstraction, and where interaction becomes introspection.
